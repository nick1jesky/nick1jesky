## Hello there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Nikolai

**Middle Developer | High-Load & Intelligent Systems**

I specialize in building scalable backend systems and applying mathematical approaches with ml-algorithms to solve complex problems. My passion lies at the intersection of high-performance computing and machine learning.

### ðŸŽ¯ My Goals

* Creation of valuable high-tech innovative products that solve real-world problems
* Become part of a leading team driving the modern technological revolution  
* Deepen my expertise in intelligent high-load systems

### ðŸ‘€ WHAT???

* `Python` is a great language, but `Go` and `Rust` are even better. I think it's time to develop a modern, high-performance language for intelligent systems that combines the benefits of both. It should be strongly typed, have a large vocabulary, and be optimized for high-performance computations at the compiler level.
Lang `Mojo` tryes to solve it, but...(There is JuliaGPU, which has a much larger background). I hope everything works out for them.
I'm afraid that `Go`, despite its potential, will remain the language for writing CRUDs. 
`Python` is obsolete, and its supposedly simple syntax is becoming a problem.

* I believe to work with Palantir, Anduril, SpaceX, ICEYE, etc. Becouse... It's C00L imho. High-tech, power, Brave New World, PayPal Mafia...

* 0ne day I will finish one of my interesting projects related to prediction and analysis of real-time data
